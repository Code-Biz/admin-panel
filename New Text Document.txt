*Services Page*
(BACKEND)
In server.js -> api/services,service-router
In routers.js -> service-router-> /all and get(services-controler)
In controller.js -> services-controller -> try logic and catch error using services-model
In models.js -> services-model and service schema
In mongodb admin-panel create services collection and add a document and then read it, 
by making request from postman or frontend to the specified route
(FRONTEND)
In Services.jsx component code css divisons. Now the logic for this style can be entered 
in this file at top of return but we'll write it in stores to keep the pages and code clean.
The data that we will get in this store via getServices() logic in useEffect, useState and Services logic in AuthContext.Provider , will be used by the services page as well as 
can also be used any other page as need. As the services state is passed to whole react application and via the AuthContext.Provider of the auth.jsx or say store.jsx (its benefit of store).
In Services.jsx include const {services} = useAuth(); to utilize this data fethced in services of useauth()
